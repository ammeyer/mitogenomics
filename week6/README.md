* Sequence alignment with [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
 * [chimp1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JF727179.2) vs [chimp2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JF727176.2)
 * [human](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/GU170821.1) vs [chimp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JF727179.2)
 * Find your own! How about squamata (snakes and lizards)
* Sequence alignment with [Biopython](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.pairwise2-module.html)
 * try shorter sequences then try the ones above
* Forward and backward thinking ... what did we do last week that you can continue working on? what can you do now to make next week easier?
 * Hint! Thinking about database design for genes and genomes
