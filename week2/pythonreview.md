### Review the Python interpreter ###
What happens when you run the following lines of code at the interpreter?

```python
>>> print("Hello World") #1
>>> print(Hello World) #2
>>> 4 * 2 #3
>>> 4 / 2 #4
>>> 3 / 2 #5
>>> interns = ['Amber', 'Chiara', 'Gina', 'Isabelle', 'Lauren', 'Vishu']
>>> interns[0] #6
>>> interns[1] #7
>>> interns[6] #8
>>> interns + 'Abby' #9
>>> interns + ['Abby'] #10
```

### Defining functions

Write your solutions in Sublime Text or any other text editor of your choosing.

##### 1

Write a function named `square` that returns the square of any number.

##### 2

Write a function named `favorite_color` that, given the name of any of the interns, returns their favorite color as a string. (You will have to ask your fellow interns for this information!)

##### 3

Write a function that uses a loop to print a list of your creation.
